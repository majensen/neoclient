=head1 SYNOPSIS

   LIBS => Neo4j::Client->libs,
   CCFLAGS => Neo4j::Client->cflags,
   ...
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Chris Leishman's
L<libneo4j-client|https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client> is a C
library for communication with a Neo4j server via the Bolt
protocol. A fork at L<https://github.com/majensen/libneo4j-omni> enables
the library to run on Neo4j versions up through 5.x.

Installing this module will attempt to build the API portion of the
library on your machine. C<libneo4j-omni>'s interactive shell and
documentation are not built. The install process will use the GNU
autotools C<autoconf-2.69>, C<automake-1.16.3>, and C<m4-1.4.18-patched>
which are bundled with this distro and are known to work on this library.
(These are required to build from ./configure for C<libneo4j-omni>.)

Thanks to the miracle of L<Alien::Build>, the library should always
contain OpenSSL support.
